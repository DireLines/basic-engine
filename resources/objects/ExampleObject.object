- Transform:
    position:
      code: Vector2(1,1)
    rotation: 5.03
- Rigidbody #you can attach a component with default values like this

#you can add more than one of a particular component type,
#but you'll have a hell of a time distinguishing between them later
- ExampleComponent:
    value: 2
    name: glorbus
    enabled: false
- ExampleComponent:
    value: 
      code: 2 + 3 #ends up in the code exactly as written
    name: 2 + 3 #ends up as a string, in quotes

#a child object; specified components will be modified rather than added
- BasicObject: 
    - name: my basic object
    - Rigidbody:
        mass: 4000
    - Transform:
        position: 
          code: this->getComponent<Transform>()->position + Vector2(4.0,4.5)
